## Standard Lifecycle States
- `draft`
- `pending_review`
- `published`
- `active`
- `paused`
- `deprecated`
- `archived`
- `failed`
- `reversed`

## State Rules
- Draft objects are editable. Published versions are immutable.
- Active versions may be paused but not silently modified.
- Failed operations must keep diagnostic metadata and may be retried only through controlled retry policy.
- Reversal must create a new fact; historical facts are never deleted.
