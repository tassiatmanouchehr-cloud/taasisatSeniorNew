## Acceptance Test Scenarios
### AT-23-001: Tenant isolation cannot be bypassed
- Given valid enterprise preconditions.
- When the scenario is executed.
- Then the expected state, event, audit and read-model result must be deterministic.

- Given valid enterprise preconditions.
- When the scenario is executed.
- Then the expected state, event, audit and read-model result must be deterministic.

### AT-23-003: Policy change affects future operations only
- Given valid enterprise preconditions.
- When the scenario is executed.
- Then the expected state, event, audit and read-model result must be deterministic.

### AT-23-004: Event payload validates against CES schema
- Given valid enterprise preconditions.
- When the scenario is executed.
- Then the expected state, event, audit and read-model result must be deterministic.

- Given valid enterprise preconditions.
- When the scenario is executed.
- Then the expected state, event, audit and read-model result must be deterministic.

### AT-23-006: Permission denied actions leave audit trace
- Given valid enterprise preconditions.
