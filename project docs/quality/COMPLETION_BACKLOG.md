## P0 — Prevents Safe Continuation or Merge

### BG-001: Commit Phase 1 OrderOffer Implementation — **COMPLETE**

**Resolution:** OrderOffer model, migration `orders/0008_orderoffer.py`, tests,
and admin were committed in `ce3b30e` ("Repository documentation
reorganization"). Verified by `git log -- src/apps/orders/migrations/0008_orderoffer.py`
and clean working tree. Closed 2026-07-14.

### BG-002: Fix Pre-Existing Seed Test order_number Collision — **COMPLETE**

**Root cause:** Random in-run collision of the 4-digit suffix in
`orders/models.py:_generate_order_number()` (10,000 numbers/day); proven by a
1/10 isolated-run failure and two full-suite errors on 2026-07-14 at ce3b30e.
**Resolution (2026-07-14):** `Order.save()` now retries auto-generation up to
`ORDER_NUMBER_MAX_ATTEMPTS` (5) times when the database unique constraint
rejects a generated number, each attempt in its own savepoint; suffix widened
to 6 digits (10^6/day). Caller-supplied duplicates still raise immediately.
No migration required. Regression tests:
`orders/tests/test_order_number_generation.py` (8 tests incl. concurrency).
See CHANGE_LEDGER CL-017 and TEST_EXECUTION_LOG Run 009.
**MERGED to main** via PR #1, merge commit `eb51018` (2026-07-14), full
regression 1680/1680 green.

### BG-015: Manual Document Verification Workflow (Phase 1.1) — **COMPLETE (caregiver + organization)**

**Resolution (2026-07-15):** `VerificationReviewService` (approve/reject/request_correction,
row-locked, tenant-scoped, self-review refused, idempotent same-outcome
no-op, audited via `AuditLog`), `accounts.document.review` permission,
`DocumentStatus.CORRECTION_REQUIRED`, admin_portal review queue/detail/
file/review views, owner-facing reason display. 41 tests (25 service +
16 view). **MERGED to main** via PR #3, merge commit `278098b` (2026-07-15),
full regression 1721/1721 green at merge.
See traceability/IMPLEMENTATION_JOURNAL.md and ARCHITECTURE_DECISION_LOG ADM-014.
**Not included:** customer document verification (see BG-016), profile
verification_status roll-up (see BG-017 — now COMPLETE, see below).

## P1 — Blocks First Complete Internal Product Workflow

### BG-016: Customer Document Verification (Domain Model Gap)

**Current evidence:** `VerificationDocument.caregiver`/`.organization` are the only
two owner FKs (CHECK-constrained exactly-one-of-two); `CustomerProfile` has no
`verification_status` field. Confirmed by repository-wide inspection during
Phase 1.1 (2026-07-15) — customer identity verification does not exist as a
domain concept anywhere in the repository.
**Why needed:** Task governance for Registration & Verification names customer
identity verification as in-scope; current domain model does not support it.
**Dependencies:** A scoped decision on whether/how to extend `VerificationDocument`'s
owner CHECK constraint (a real architectural change, not a bug fix).
**Affected modules:** accounts
**Suggested implementation size:** Medium (new FK + constraint migration + service/view work)
**Risk:** Low-medium — additive to an existing, deliberately-designed constraint
**Not in scope:** Profile roll-up (BG-017)

### BG-017: Profile Verification Status Roll-Up — **COMPLETE**

**Resolution (2026-07-15, Phase 1.2):** `RequiredDocumentPolicy` (Part A —
the previously-missing policy: caregiver = IDENTITY + BACKGROUND_CHECK
required, organization = REGISTRATION + OPERATING_LICENSE required,
tenant-overridable via `ConfigResolver`, no migration) +
`ProfileVerificationRollupService` (Part B — derives the existing 4-value
`VerificationStatus` enum from required-document state; wired into
`VerificationReviewService`/`DocumentService.resubmit()`, never a view/
signal). Also delivered in the same slice: `DocumentService.resubmit()`
(Part C — owner-authorized correction/resubmission, blocks silent
replacement of a VERIFIED document) and `ActivationEligibilityService`
(Part D — read-only, structured eligibility for caregiver/organization).
47 new tests, zero new migrations. Branch
`phase1-verification-activation-rules`, PR pending merge. See
traceability/IMPLEMENTATION_JOURNAL.md and ARCHITECTURE_DECISION_LOG ADM-015.
**Not included:** wiring `ActivationEligibilityService` into an actual
activation/publishing action (currently read-only — see BG-018);
`profile_completion_percent` auto-recompute on every mutation (see BG-018).

### BG-018: Activation Wiring and Profile Completion Auto-Recompute

**Current evidence:** `ActivationEligibilityService.evaluate()` (BG-017) is
a pure read-only query; nothing calls it to actually activate/publish a
profile. `calculate_caregiver_profile_completion()`/
`calculate_organization_profile_completion()` exist and are read by
`ActivationEligibilityService`, but `profile_completion_percent` is not
automatically recomputed/persisted on every profile mutation.
**Why needed:** Roadmap Phase 1's acceptance criterion 5 ("Profile
completion percent recomputed on every profile mutation") remains open;
`ActivationEligibilityService` has no consumer yet.
**Dependencies:** BG-017 (done)
**Affected modules:** accounts
**Suggested implementation size:** Small-medium
**Risk:** Low
**Not in scope:** Marketplace visibility wiring (`is_publicly_visible()` is
a separate, existing, unrelated concern — see `traceability/IMPLEMENTATION_JOURNAL.md`)

### BG-003: OrderOfferService (Phase 2)

**Current evidence:** Phase 1 model exists. No service layer.
**Why needed:** Offer Marketplace cannot function without services to submit/edit/withdraw/select offers.
**Dependencies:** BG-001 (commit Phase 1)
**Affected modules:** orders
**Suggested implementation size:** Medium (1 service class + tests)
**Required tests:** Unit tests with PostgreSQL, concurrency tests
**Risk:** Medium — must not break existing assignment flow
**Not in scope:** Discovery, views, templates, APIs, payment integration

### BG-004: Implement Real PSP Adapter

**Current evidence:** Only `FakePaymentProviderAdapter` exists. All payment flows are mocked.
**Why needed:** Cannot process real payments without a real PSP.
**Affected modules:** payments
**Suggested implementation size:** Large (adapter + integration tests + configuration)
**Required tests:** Integration tests with sandbox PSP
**Risk:** High — financial correctness critical
**Not in scope:** Multiple PSP support, payment method diversity

### BG-005: Implement Real Notification Providers

**Current evidence:** Only fake SMS/email/push providers exist.
**Why needed:** Cannot send real notifications to users.
**Affected modules:** notifications
**Suggested implementation size:** Medium (per-provider adapter)
**Required tests:** Integration tests with sandbox providers
**Risk:** Medium — operational requirement
**Not in scope:** Multi-channel notification preferences

## P2 — Blocks External Pilot

### BG-006: Production Deployment Configuration

**Current evidence:** No docker-compose production config, no production settings beyond security headers.
**Why needed:** Cannot deploy to production.
**Affected modules:** config
**Suggested implementation size:** Medium
**Risk:** Medium
**Not in scope:** Kubernetes, auto-scaling

### BG-007: Enable Deadline Expiry Gate

**Current evidence:** `deadline_activation_enabled` defaults to DISABLED. Payment deadlines are created but don't auto-expire.
**Why needed:** Orders will remain in limbo if deadlines don't expire.
**Affected modules:** commission
**Suggested implementation size:** Small (config change + verification)
**Risk:** Medium — must verify expiry cascade works correctly
**Not in scope:** Deadline extension UI

### BG-008: Enable Pre-Service Payment Gate

**Current evidence:** `preservice_payment_enabled` defaults to DISABLED. No escrow hold before service.
**Why needed:** Financial protection for providers requires escrow.
**Affected modules:** commission, finance
**Suggested implementation size:** Medium (gate enablement + integration verification)
**Risk:** High — financial flow change
**Not in scope:** Customer payment UI

## P3 — Blocks Production Launch

### BG-009: Tenant Isolation Hardening

**Current evidence:** No middleware-level tenant injection. Depends on developer discipline.
**Why needed:** Cross-tenant data leak is the highest-severity security risk.
**Affected modules:** All
**Suggested implementation size:** Large (middleware + audit + row-level security)
**Risk:** High — architectural change
**Not in scope:** Multi-region deployment

### BG-010: CI Pipeline Activation

**Current evidence:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` exists but never executed.
**Why needed:** No automated test execution on PRs.
**Affected modules:** DevOps
**Suggested implementation size:** Small
**Risk:** Low
**Not in scope:** Full CI/CD pipeline

### BG-011: RBAC Enforcement Audit Logging

**Current evidence:** No audit when `rbac.enforcement.enabled` is toggled.
**Why needed:** Security compliance.
**Affected modules:** kernel
**Suggested implementation size:** Small
**Risk:** Low
**Not in scope:** RBAC redesign

## P4 — Post-Launch or Optimization

### BG-012: Remove Legacy Wallet from finance App

**Current evidence:** `finance.WalletAccount`/`WalletTransaction` superseded by `apps.wallet`.
**Why needed:** Reduce confusion.
**Affected modules:** finance
**Suggested implementation size:** Small
**Risk:** Low
**Not in scope:** Data migration

### BG-013: Add Tests for common App

**Current evidence:** Zero tests for shared utilities imported across apps.
**Why needed:** Regression protection for foundational code.
**Affected modules:** common
**Suggested implementation size:** Small
**Risk:** Low
**Not in scope:** Full coverage

### BG-014: Extract Shared Auth Guard

**Current evidence:** Each portal independently implements `_guard()`.
**Why needed:** DRY principle, single enforcement point.
**Affected modules:** All portals
**Suggested implementation size:** Medium
**Risk:** Low
**Not in scope:** Middleware redesign
