## CURRENT STATE

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Working tree | Clean at verification time |
| Offer Marketplace Phase 1 | **COMMITTED** in `ce3b30e`, now on main (OrderOffer model, migration `orders/0008_orderoffer.py`, admin, 40 tests) |
| BG-002 | **MERGED to main** via PR #1 (merge commit `eb51018`); full regression 1680/1680 green at merge |
| Current phase | **Phase 1 — Registration and Verification Workflows is the ACTIVE implementation phase** (see `IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md`); implementation not yet started |
| Active blocker | `makemigrations --check` cosmetic drift only (pre-existing, exit 1, accounts/kernel field alters — no schema change intended) |
| Active work branch | `claude/taasisat-senior-state-verify-9dzzlm` (restarted from merged main after PR #1) |

## ACTIVE DOCUMENTATION

All active documentation is under: **`project docs/`**

Start with: **`project docs/00_START_HERE.md`**

The active implementation order is: **`project docs/IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md`**

`canonical docs/` and `mimo change/` are NOT active paths — their content was
reorganized into `project docs/` and the originals archived under `_archive/`.

## HOW TO CONTINUE

1. Read `project docs/00_START_HERE.md` for documentation structure
2. Read this file for current state
3. Read `project docs/03_NEXT_TASK.md` for the immediate next objective
4. Read `project docs/IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` for the phase order
5. Always inspect the repository — never trust memory or previous reports
6. Continue only from the current repository state
7. Never skip documentation — update `project docs/traceability/` for every change
8. Never skip testing — run targeted tests and full regression
9. Never expand scope — complete only what is approved
10. Wait for review before continuing to next phase
